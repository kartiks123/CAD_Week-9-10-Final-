The above code uses the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm to establish a shared secret key between the sender and receiver, which is then used to encrypt and decrypt the text messages. 

The `DiffieHellmanMapper` class generates a random prime number `p`, a primitive root `g` of `p`, and a private key `a`, and then sends the public key `A = g^a mod p` to the `DiffieHellmanReducer` class. The reducer generates another private key `b` and computes the shared secret key `S = A^b mod p`using the received public key `A`. The shared secret key is then sent back to the mapper class for encryption/decryption.

To use this code, we can run the following command in your terminal:
$ hadoop jar diffiehellman.jar DiffieHellmanMapReduce input.txt output
Where `input.txt` is the input file containing the text to be encrypted/decrypted, and `output` is the output directory where the encrypted/decrypted text will be saved.


MapReduce is a programming model and software framework for processing large amounts of data in a distributed computing environment. It was developed by Google and is now widely used for big data processing and analytics.

The MapReduce model consists of two phases: the map phase and the reduce phase. In the map phase, the input data is divided into smaller chunks and processed by multiple map functions in parallel. Each map function takes an input key-value pair and produces one or more intermediate key-value pairs as output. The intermediate key-value pairs are then sorted and grouped by key before being passed to the reduce phase.

In the reduce phase, the intermediate key-value pairs are processed by multiple reduce functions in parallel. Each reduce function takes a key and a set of values as input and produces one or more output key-value pairs. The output of the reduce phase is the final result of the MapReduce computation.

MapReduce is designed to run on a large cluster of commodity hardware, such as servers or nodes in a cloud environment. It provides automatic parallelization and fault tolerance, which allows it to handle large-scale data processing tasks efficiently and reliably.

MapReduce has been widely used in a variety of applications, such as data warehousing, search engines, recommendation systems, and machine learning. It has also inspired the development of other big data processing frameworks, such as Apache Hadoop, which provides an open-source implementation of the MapReduce model.
